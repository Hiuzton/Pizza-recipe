    public static final String PIZZA_1_DESCRIPTION="The most classic of our pizza recipes: The Margherita! This is the best margherita pizza recipe out there, based on our visits to Italy and years of research!";
    public static final String PIZZA_1_RECIPE="What’s on a margherita pizza? In Italy, the traditional margherita pizza ingredients for toppings are mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and basil. The sauce is generally made from crushed tomatoes, seasoned with garlic, salt and herbs. Often the cheese used is mozzarella di bufala, a fresh cheese made from the milk of water buffalos that has a creamy texture and delicate flavor.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "To make homemade margerita pizza, because the toppings are so simple, they must be top quality. Here’s what you’ll need:\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Tomatoes: Our margherita pizza sauce is a quick blender sauce made with canned fire roasted tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt and herbs. Fire roasted tomatoes have a sweet smoky flavor and are easily available at most US grocery stores. Another great option is San Marzano tomatoes. If you can’t find either, use the best quality canned tomatoes you can find.\n" +
            "Cheese: The best mozzarella for pizza? Use fresh mozzarella cheese, the kind sold in balls, then cut it into small pieces for overall coverage. A light topping of grated Parmesan cheese adds complexity.\n" +
            "Basil: Using fresh basil is key to the flavor of a great margherita pizza. A tip? Add to the pizza after baking so that is stays beautifully green. Fresh basil that is baked in the oven turns black within a few minutes.\n" +
            "It takes a little bit of practice, but you’ll be making homemade margherita pizza in no time! You can put your know-how to use in our other favorite pizza recipes, too. Let us know what you think of this Italian icon: it really is the best pizza you can make at home!";
